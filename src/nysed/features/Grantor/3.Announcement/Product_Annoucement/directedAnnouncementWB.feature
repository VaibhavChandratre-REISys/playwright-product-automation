    Given I expand nested table containing column value "BP01"
    And I edit the following rows inline in flex table with id "---applicationIntake:-:budgetPeriodTableId---" by clicking "Edit" :
      | Category Name | Budget | Cash Match | Non-Cash Match | Other Leverage |
      | Construction  | 1500   | 100        | 100            | 100            |
    And I refresh the page
    When I navigate to "Budget" sub tab
    Then I softly see field "Budgeted Amount" as "$1,500.00"
    When I click on "Submit to Grantor" in the page details
    And I wait for "2" seconds
    Then I cannot see the following messages in the page details contains:
      | Budget Tab - The Budgeted Amount must be equal to the Recommended Amount. |
    Then I softly see field "Status" as "Negotiation Submitted"

    Examples:
      | Announcement Name                            | User |
      | {SavedValue:Automation Runtime Announcement} | PM   |
